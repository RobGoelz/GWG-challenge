Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned?
	I have learned a bit more about the elements like superscript and horizontal 		breaks - which I haven’t had the chance to use before.
What has been easy?
	A lot of the html reference stuff is very familiar to me from earlier web work.
What has been difficult?
	The figure and figure caption stuff is brand new and it took me a while to wrap my 	head around it.
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
	So I’ll plug away at something until I get stuck, then I’ll plug away some more and start looking for answers online. If I can’t find anything there, I’ll ask in the Forum or Slack Chat.
