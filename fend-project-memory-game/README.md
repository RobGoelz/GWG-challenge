# Memory Game Project
This is my version of the classic memory game "Concentration", created as a
project for the Udacity Front-End Web Development [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)
program.

The starter HTML, CSS, and shuffle function was provided by
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). All other work is mine, and any help I've
found is documented under [Hints](#hints).

## Instructions

This game tests your memory of icons, using 8 icons that must be
matched with their partner (total of 16 icons).

 1. Click on one card at a time and try to find its match.
 2. When you find it's match the cards will lock and turn green.
 3. Find and match all icons to win.

Scoring:

* Match all icons in under 20 moves - 3 stars
* Match all icons in 20 moves - 2 stars
* Match all icons in 30 moves - 1 stars
* Match all icons in 40 moves - 0 stars

## Contributing

This repository is a fork of the the starter code for _all_ Udacity students,
but the majority of JS code is mine and I welcome constructive criticism or
help to make this program better!
